Create the environment from the argos.yml file.

    conda env create -f argos.yml
    
Then set up a jupyter notebook kernel from the environment. If
your environment is called something else, you would run "conda
activate [env_name]" instead of "conda activate argos."

    conda activate argos
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name argos
    
Then after shutting down the kernel if you had the notebook 
already running, open up the plotting.ipynb notebook. You should
be able to select the "argos" kernel via "Kernel > Change Kernel."
